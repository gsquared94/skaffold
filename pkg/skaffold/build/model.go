// This notifies all listeners waiting for this artifact of a successful or failed build.
// Additionally it has a reference to the channels for each of its dependencies.
// Calling `waitForDependencies` ensures that all required artifacts' channels have already been closed and as such have finished building before the current artifact build starts.
